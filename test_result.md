# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Phase 3: Evidence Discovery & Synthesis System initiated. Added missing API endpoints for evidence synthesis: POST /api/evidence/synthesize-protocol enables AI-driven protocol creation from latest literature, GET /api/evidence/synthesis-status provides system status. The comprehensive evidence synthesis engine from advanced_services.py is now fully exposed to the frontend. System can perform comprehensive literature analysis, real-world outcome integration, and generate evidence-based protocols with confidence scores. Ready for backend testing of new endpoints."

    message: "🎉 GOOGLE SCHOLAR INTEGRATION SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED - ALL SUCCESS CRITERIA EXCEEDED! ✅ Core Functionality: GET /api/literature/google-scholar-search endpoint fully operational with HTML parsing, relevance scoring (0.05-0.85 range), and comprehensive paper extraction (titles, authors, journals, years, abstracts, citation counts). ✅ Multi-Source Search: GET /api/literature/multi-source-search successfully combines PubMed and Google Scholar results with effective deduplication and proper source statistics reporting. ✅ Advanced Features: Year filtering working correctly (2023+ filter tested), error handling graceful for invalid queries, database storage with proper source attribution functional. ✅ Integration Testing: Evidence extraction helper methods operational, papers properly categorized by source, relevance scoring across different sources working. ✅ Technical Implementation: Fixed missing BeautifulSoup4 dependency, HTML parsing quality excellent, deduplication preventing duplicate papers, source statistics showing papers found from each source. ✅ Performance: 100% test success rate (10/10 comprehensive tests passed), system handles rate limiting gracefully, broader literature coverage achieved including conference papers and international publications. Minor: Some specific queries return fewer results due to search variations, but this is expected behavior. Google Scholar integration significantly expands literature coverage beyond PubMed as requested."
