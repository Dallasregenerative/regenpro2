The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a general AI diagnostic system into a highly specialized, practitioner-facing regenerative medicine knowledge platform. The development trajectory began with clarifying the core MVP features, leading to an initial build for patient data input and AI-powered diagnostic suggestions. A critical phase involved pivoting the project from a general medical tool to a dedicated medical intelligence system for regenerative medicine, emphasizing knowledge synthesis over practice management. This refined vision led to the implementation of advanced features like federated learning, real-time literature integration, advanced DICOM processing, and outcome prediction. The final, ongoing task involves building a comprehensive multi-modal file upload and analysis system to directly feed into protocol generation, demonstrating a clear progression towards a data-rich, AI-driven knowledge hub.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to create the world's most sophisticated AI-powered platform for regenerative medicine practitioners. This platform must generate personalized, evidence-based treatment protocols, predict patient outcomes, continuously learn from real-world data, and serve as the definitive global resource for regenerative medicine knowledge. It is explicitly not a practice management tool.

Key features include:
- Multi-modal data ingestion (EHR/FHIR, DICOM, labs, genomics, wearables) for comprehensive patient profiling.
- AI-powered diagnostic suggestions and personalized protocol generation with outcome/timeline predictions.
- Practitioner choice of schools of thought (e.g., PRP, BMAC, MSC Exosomes) with an AI-Optimized Best Protocol option.
- Explainable AI (SHAP + LIME) for transparency in every diagnosis and protocol element.
- Continuous self-learning via federated learning and practitioner feedback.
- Exhaustive, real-time literature integration (Google Scholar, PubMed, pre-prints, patents) for living systematic reviews and contradiction detection.
- Comprehensive evidence tables and global legal status flagging for therapies.
- Advanced imaging analytics, multi-omic integration, and predictive research analytics.
- A practitioner-facing UI guiding through patient intake, data upload, assessment, protocol generation, and monitoring.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully integrate the analysis of uploaded patient charts, genetic tests, and imaging data into the AI protocol generation workflow, beyond just the file upload mechanism.
- Ensure the advanced features (Federated Learning, PubMed, DICOM, Outcome Prediction) are seamlessly functional and provide meaningful insights based on actual uploaded data, as the current implementation might be more of a simulation for demonstration.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on implementing a comprehensive multi-modal file upload and analysis system. This allows practitioners to upload patient charts (PDF, DOCX), genetic test results (TXT, JSON), and medical imaging (DICOM, JPG, PNG) directly into the platform.

The work involves:
1.  **Backend ()**: A new module  has been created. This module includes a  class with methods to:
    *   : A high-level function to dispatch files based on their type.
    *   : Handles parsing of patient charts (PDF, DOCX).
    *   : Handles parsing of genetic data (TXT, JSON).
    *   : Handles parsing of medical images (DICOM, JPG, PNG) using libraries like , , and .
    *   : Designed to extract relevant information from the processed files to inform the AI protocol generation.
2.  **Backend ()**: The  file has been updated to import  and expose new API endpoints for file uploads. These endpoints are designed to receive files, trigger their processing via the , and potentially queue them for deeper AI analysis for protocol generation.
3.  **Backend ()**: Dependencies required for file parsing and image processing (e.g., , , , ) have been added.
4.  **Frontend ()**: The frontend is being enhanced with a dedicated File Upload tab. This tab will provide the UI for practitioners to select and upload their multi-modal patient data, and likely display upload progress and initial validation results. The last action was specifically adding this new tab to the main interface.

The current state allows files to be uploaded and processed, but the full integration where these processed files directly *drive* the AI's diagnostic and protocol generation capabilities, beyond just basic analysis, is the nuance currently being addressed.
